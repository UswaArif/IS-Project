# IS-Project - Online Banking System
The primary objective of this project is to address the inherent vulnerabilities associated with traditional online banking systems, particularly concerning the transmission of sensitive transaction data. This Project is about Online Banking System and to apply Steganography for Secure Transaction. Steganography is the process of masking sensitive information in any media to transfer it securely over the underlying unreliable and insecure communication network. In Steganography, the transaction data will hide into the image so that if unauthorized access take place, the user will only have access to the image, not the data. To protect this information from unauthorized access and tampering various methods for information hiding like, hashing, cryptography, authentication and stegnaography have been established.
